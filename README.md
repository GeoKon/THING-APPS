# THING-APPS

The following Applications included in this repository:

** WiFi Multimeter ** -- see `/apps/BT35T-Thing`
** Sonoff Switches ** -- see `/apps/SFSW-Thing`
** Thermostat Hub ** -- see `/apps/THUB-Thing`

The respective markdown documents are placed in both areas, this root directory and also in the above sub-directories.

Each app sub-directory includes all necessary files to build the application. They all use extensively the lower layer libraries GKESP-L1 and GKESP-L2. In addition, they use the Thinger.io library which can be downloaded directly from the Thinger.io site.

In addition, each app sub-directory includes a `/doc-assets` area for images and selected .ppt and .doc files. Such files are either posted in LFS or not tracked.
  
The `/src` is reserved for common code used across one or more of the above applications. For now, this sub-directory is empty.
